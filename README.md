# Drift Language

_Drift is an experimental language, designed and developed by
[**belicfr**](https://github.com/belicfr).
It is a concise language inspired by **Kotlin**, **Swift**, **C#** and **TypeScript**.
It is designed to offer a modern, lightweight, but customizable, syntax._

This repository is composed of three modules:

- [**Drift Core**](https://github.com/drift-language/drift/tree/main/drift-core):
The core of the language, with all internal systems, the lexer, the parser and the runtime.
- [**Drift Common**](https://github.com/drift-language/drift/tree/main/drift-common):
A bridge module which permits sharing Drift generic information to both other modules.
- [**Drift CLI**](https://github.com/drift-language/drift/tree/main/drift-cli):
A basic CLI with two modes: **Drift CLI** and **Drift Debugger**. It is designed and coded to
be easily understandable and ergonomic.
